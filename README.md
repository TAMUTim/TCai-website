# TCai-website

A whole new year of learning means a whole new website for Tim!

## Goals

I wanted to create a website with the following attributes:
 - Fun to look at
 - Interesting to interact with
 - Informative

## Technologies

I wanted to use technologies that interested me and I haven't used before.
This project uses the following tech:

 - Firebase, for hosting
 - Three.js, for cool 3d stuff
 - React, for being not Angular 
 ...
